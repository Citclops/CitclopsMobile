    <string name="help_2_pgrf1">Colour, together with clarity, is one of the most apparent characteristics to the human eye when observing natural water. In general, the apparent colour is a result of substances that are either suspended or dissolved in the water column. There are 3 main natural components, besides the water itself (blue), affecting the water colour and clarity in natural environments:</string>
    <string name="help_2_pgrf2">1) <b>Phytoplankton</b> (generally green)\n2) <b>Non-algal matter, such as fine soils</b> (milky, grey to dark)\n3) <b>Dissolved organic matter</b> (yellow to brownish)</string>

   	<string name="help_3_pgrf1">The Forel-Ule (FU) scale is used to approximately determine the colour of natural waters, used in limnology and oceanography. The modern FU scale can be manufactured with high-quality colour-effect lighting filters, an improvement with respect to the materials employed to manufacture the original scale from the 19th century, which required the mixing of noxious chemicals. The colour graduations correspond to open sea and lake water bodies (from blue to brown, going through green), as they appear to an observer. The scale is used together with the Secchi disk (SD) submersed to half the Secchi disk depth (SDD).</string>

   	<string name="help_4_pgrf1"><i>Modern FU scale colour comparison using Secchi disk.</i></string>
   	<string name="help_4_pgrf2">•	If possible the measurement should be done in the shade. Don’t wear sunglasses.\n•	Slowly lower the Secchi Disk (SD) into the water until it disappears from sight and note this depth. This is the Secchi Disk Depth (SDD). \n•	Slowly raise the disk until half the SDD. \n•	With the Forel-Ule (FU) scale in the shade (avoiding direct sunlight), compare the colour observed above the SD, with the colours of the scale over the white bars in the back. \n•	Record FU number </string>
   	
   	<string name="help_5_pgrf1">The Citclops Colour App makes use of 21 predefined colours that are equal to the colours of the traditional Forel-Ule colour comparator scale (see Forel-Ule scale section). The human eye can accurately match colours when viewed simultaneously.  So, the idea is to compare the colour of natural waters (river, lake, sea) with the Forel-Ule coloured bars as shown on the screen of you Smartphone or Smartcamera.</string>
   	<string name="help_5_pgrf2">The App can be used on its own or in combination with (preferable) Secchi disk and/or modern Forel-Ule scale.</string>

   	<string name="help_7_pgrf1">Navigators have observed with great attention the varying tints displayed by the ocean and the circumstances that apparently influence those tints. Concerning observations on the colour of the sea a general question remained to be answered: what is the true colour of the sea? To answer this question scientists proposed techniques to establish the colour of natural water by means of comparison against some colour(ed) standard. The first note mentioning such a standard, if we do not take into account De Saussure’s cyanometer (1791), already mentioned before and Arago’s cyanometer (1845), dates back to a session of ‘Société vaudoise des sciences naturelles, Lausanne 21s’ of December 1887. Here François Alphonse Forel proposes a thirteen-colour scale for a quick identification of the colour of sea, lake or river water, covering the blue to green region. </string>
   	<string name="help_7_pgrf2">In 1892, Willi Ule extended the scale towards the brownish colours. Since then, the scale became known as the Forel-Ule scale (21 tube colours) or Xantho-meter and evolved to the most common and well-known colour scale used to determine the colour of seas, lakes and rivers. In the past, hundreds-thousands of colour observations) were conducted all over the world (around 250 000 archived by the U.S. National Oceanographic Data Centre) and even at this moment, the scale is still in use. An example of a sea colour map (Schott, 1912, pp. 125-127 and Table VIII) obtained from Forel-Ule observations was published by Schott in 1912 in his Geography of the Atlantic Ocean).</string>
